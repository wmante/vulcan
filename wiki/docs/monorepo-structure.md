# Monorepo Structure

This document describes the structure of our monorepo and the reasoning behind our architectural decisions.

## Directory Structure

The repository is organized into the following main directories:

- `apps/`: Contains all user-facing applications
- `packages/`: Contains shared internal packages
- `tools/`: Contains development and build tools
- `config/`: Contains configuration files
- `docs/`: Contains documentation
- `tests/`: Contains test suites
- `scripts/`: Contains utility scripts

## Package Management

We use PNPM with workspaces for efficient package management. This allows us to:

1. Share dependencies between packages
2. Ensure consistent versioning
3. Optimize build times with caching

## Build System

We use Turborepo as our build system, which provides:

1. Incremental builds
2. Caching of build artifacts
3. Parallel execution of tasks
4. Dependency graph awareness

## Dependency Management

Dependencies are managed at two levels:

1. **Root dependencies**: Development tools and utilities used across the entire repository
2. **Package dependencies**: Libraries specific to each package

## Versioning Strategy

We follow a unified versioning strategy for all packages in the monorepo:

1. All packages share the same version number
2. Version bumps are coordinated across all packages
3. We use Conventional Commits to automate versioning
